/**
 * OnboardingSheet — first-visit info sheet introducing the Quick Bet
 * (long-press) gesture. Figma `buttonSheet` (node 34715:77896, file
 * OBq6XxCPiveHmdSKScTtq2).
 *
 * FOCUS/DISMISSAL PASS (Task 6.3):
 *   - The sheet no longer spans the full viewport — it stops a responsive
 *     gap below the top edge (TOP_GAP_PERCENT) so a visible strip of
 *     overlay is always tappable-to-dismiss, while the backdrop itself
 *     still covers the entire viewport including the header.
 *   - The close × button now has an explicit z-index (see the fix note by
 *     its JSX) — it was previously losing hit-testing to the decorative
 *     demo-loop layer despite being visually on top.
 *   - Swipe-to-close now works from within the scrollable content too,
 *     gated on "already scrolled to top + gesture is clearly downward",
 *     via Framer's onPan/onPanStart/onPanEnd (no new dependency) — see the
 *     handleContentPan* functions. The footer/gap-area drag path (Framer's
 *     `drag="y"` + manual dragControls, from Task 6.2) is unchanged.
 *   - Escape key closes the sheet on desktop.
 *   - Every dismissal path (×, backdrop tap, swipe from either gesture
 *     path, Omitir, valid Jugar-ahora, Escape) calls the SAME `onClose`
 *     prop — there is only ever one close function.
 *
 * PRODUCT RULE PASS — a long-press never places a bet by itself (an entry
 * requires at least 2 selections, see buttonProgressionConfig's
 * `slipEntry`), so the old per-hold default-stake step (with its own
 * validated amount input) is gone. "Jugar ahora" now only gates on the
 * odds-change checkbox (Figma node 34715:77914) — a real
 * `<input type="checkbox">` for full mouse/touch/keyboard support, styled
 * to match its Figma checked state (filled with the primary CTA gradient +
 * a checkmark) via a decorative sibling box, since real checkboxes can't be
 * restyled to an arbitrary gradient shape via `appearance` alone
 * cross-browser.

                hidden (opacity-0, absolutely positioned, but still in the
                tab order and hit-testable) over a decorative sibling box
                that renders the actual look, since real checkboxes can't
                be restyled to an arbitrary shape/gradient cross-browser via
                `appearance` alone. Tapping the <label> (row) OR the input
                itself toggles it — the label wraps both. Checked state
                (Figma): filled with the same primary gradient token as the
                "Jugar ahora" CTA (Action/actionPrimaryDefault resolves to
                the app's one purple CTA gradient) + a white checkmark, same
                20px size / 6px radius as the unchecked box. Checkmark is
                `checkbox-check.svg`, the exact asset uploaded for this
                control (assets/checkbox-check.svg) — not the reused
                success-check.png placeholder from the first pass. No focus
                treatment on this control (removed per explicit feedback —
                the checkbox only ever shows its default/checked/error
                border, never a white focus stroke). The validation
                highlight (`checkboxError`, red) is a separate color channel
                from the checked fill, so re-checking the box doesn't have
                to fight the error styling for priority. */}

/**
 * Task 7 — the Quick Bet instructional animation. A visual REPLICA of the
 * real odds pill (PromoCarousel's `.qb-hold` buttons in HomeScreen.tsx),
 * not the real component: mounting the actual pick button here would drag
 * in `useLongPress`, `selectedIds`, and the rest of the live bet-slip
 * state this demo must stay isolated from. It shows exactly ONE selection
 * end-to-end — press-and-hold → progressive fill → completion → selected
 * state → ticket confirmation — reusing the real tokens/primitives at
 * every step instead of approximating them:
 *   - `.qb-hold` (index.css) for the fill/stroke, driven by the same
 *     registered custom properties (`--qb-progress` / `--qb-stroke-progress`)
 *     the real hold writes per-frame. Here a CSS keyframe loop writes them
 *     instead — no rAF loop, no event handlers, nothing that could fire a
 *     real bet.
 *   - The exact selected-state classes (border `#d2ff72`, lime→cyan
 *     gradient, bold odds value) for the "completed" face.
 *   - `TicketFace` (exported from EntryCreatedOverlay.tsx) for the
 *     confirmation — the actual ticket shape/checkmark/colors, not a
 *     reinvented one. Its reveal/pop/glow are re-timed into this same CSS
 *     loop (see the qbDemoTicket* keyframes in index.css for why: those
 *     effects are mount-triggered one-shots over there, and need to repeat
 *     every cycle here).
 *   - The hold segment intentionally uses a SHORTER demo-only duration
 *     (1500ms) than `buttonProgressionConfig.longPress.durationMs` (the
 *     real 3000ms hold) — watching the full-width pill fill for a real 3s
 *     on every loop of a repeating preview read as too slow, so this is a
 *     deliberate pacing choice, not an attempt to mirror the real timing
 *     exactly (see the comment block above `qbDemoProgress` in index.css).
 *
 * The touch pointer (`.qb-demo-pointer`) is a plain circular div — opacity
 * + scale only, so it never actually moves off the selection's center —
 * styled after the circular touch-emulation indicator browser devtools
 * show in mobile-preview mode (translucent, no cursor arrow), per the
 * task's spec.
 *
 * The loop itself needs no JS ticking at all — pure `animation: infinite`
 * — so it costs nothing extra while idle and stops doing any work the
 * instant this component unmounts (the sheet closing). `pointer-events-none`
 * keeps it (like the placeholder it replaces) incapable of capturing a tap
 * meant for the close button or backdrop.
